# Generative Models Course Project  
This repository contains generative model implementations for the Generative Models course at Sharif University of Technology, taught by Dr. Seyed Sallehi.

## Project Structure  
- **Autoregressive Models**: PixelCNN, Transformer for image and text generation.
- **Diffusion Models**: Continuous diffusion implementation and samples.  
- **EBM**: EBM for MNIST and Normalizing Flows.
- **Final Project**: Improved discrete and continuous-time denoising diffusion. Includes training results and comparison with the original method.
- **VAE**: BetaVAE and Pix2Pix for image generation and translation.
- **Markov Random Field Denoising**: Image denoising using MRF.
